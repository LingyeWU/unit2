Journal for Monday, November 4th
Today we went over the Unit 2 project and how it'll try and translate between Morse code and binary. I then detailed this problem in the README of this repository. We also learned a little about arduinos and downloaded the software to use arduinos. 

Journal from Sunday, November 10th for For Loops
When trying to code the for loops using the language an Arduino uses, C++, the computational logic held true. Thus, making a system diagram for what we had to proved relatively easy. Finding the correct syntax and then coding the actual program was definitely the harder portion. Research had to be done to figure out the proper syntax and all of those related actions. 

Journal from Monday, November 11th 
Today, we looked at our code for the traffic light problem. From there, we also looked at how to actually run this program on a real arduino rather than a simulated circuit.
