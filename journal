Journal: Reflection on what we did, what we learned, what questions I have, to do list

Journal for Monday, November 4th
	Today we went over the Unit 2 project and how it'll try and translate between Morse code and binary. I then detailed this problem in the README of this repository. We also learned a little about arduinos and downloaded the software to use arduinos. 

Journal from Sunday, November 10th for For Loops
	When trying to code the for loops using the language an Arduino uses, C++, the computational logic held true. Thus, making a system diagram for what we had to proved relatively easy. Finding the correct syntax and then coding the actual program was definitely the harder portion. Research had to be done to figure out the proper syntax and all of those related actions. 

Journal from Monday, November 11th 
	Today, we looked at our code for the traffic light problem. From there, we also looked at how to actually run this program on a real arduino rather than a simulated circuit. 

Journal from Wednesday, November 13th
	Today, we looked at how to make a light flash. This included the light blinkng at different intervals. We also tried to do this but with using multiple lights. On top of that, we tried to find a way to convert decimal numbers to binary. Some of the code and circuitry regarding the flashing lights can be found on the README of this repository.

Journal from Monday, November 18th
	Today, we looked at logic gates. We learned about gates such as "or," "and," "not," and "xor." These functions were confusing in the beginning but after recognizing the pattern in how they work, they definitely make sense. I still am not completely sure on how the gates and the equation for an output can be integrated into the code of a program, however. We also learned about different ways to represent a number such as binary and hexadecimal. We learned how to convert from decimal to these bases and vice versa.  

Journal from Tuesday, November 19th
	On this day, we practiced more with using logic gates by looking at diagrams at then creating logic equations. From there, we did the opposite and created diagrams for logic equations. Then, we simplified K-map tables into logic equations and finally, applied all of this to a real question related to an alarm system within a house. These activities were quite helpful in that they helped me to better understand logic equations and especially how to create the most simplified equations possible by factoring. In addition, creating a table of binary addition and multiplication helped me to better understand how to create equations for inputs and outputs. 

Journal from Wednesday, November 20th
	Today, we applied everything we've been learning the past two days towards creating a system which utilizes three buttons to show a number using seven segments of LEDs. While I was confused in the beginning, I eventually understood that we had to create a table with all of the possible inputs and then have each one of the seven seperate segments be a different output. Then, we could find one equation for each output and set that to a variable. In the beginning, I actually used "if then" statements though; however, I realized that I needed to change it to a variable to increase efficiency. While I finished all of the coding on this day, I still did not finish the circuitry because I am not completely sure how to hook up seven LEDs to three buttons in a "7-segment" pattern. Thus, I hope I can find the answer to this either online or during the next class. 
	To Do List:
	1. See how to hook up seven LEDs to one breadboard
	2. Work on README file
	
Journal from Friday, Novemebr 22nd
Today. we worked on creating the circuit which can have the seven segment number. I still didn't understand how to correctly hook everything up but I finally got the code to work. My question is how to attach seven separate LEDs and also how to use the built in seven segment display. We also got assigned which planet we would be working on: I am working on Earth so my responsibility is to translate from morse code to English and vice versa. We then worked on creating a system diagram to begin our work for this project. 

Journal from Monday, November 25th, 2019
We worked on creating the input methods to enter English into our future program. We did this by having two buttons and then trying to create a system in which the program cycles through letters and numbers of the English alphabet. Then, when a button is pressed, one of the letters or numbers is put down. It was difficult to find code in which the system cycles through all of the different characters but I eventually used a while loop. While I believe I have all of the pseudocode done, I still need to figure out the exact syntax and circuitry for this system as well.
