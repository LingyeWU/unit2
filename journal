Journal: Reflection on What We Learned, what we did, questions I might have, etc.

Journal for Monday, November 4th
	Today we went over the Unit 2 project and how it'll try and translate between Morse code and binary. I then detailed this problem in the README of this repository. We also learned a little about arduinos and downloaded the software to use arduinos. 

Journal from Sunday, November 10th for For Loops
	When trying to code the for loops using the language an Arduino uses, C++, the computational logic held true. Thus, making a system diagram for what we had to proved relatively easy. Finding the correct syntax and then coding the actual program was definitely the harder portion. Research had to be done to figure out the proper syntax and all of those related actions. 

Journal from Monday, November 11th 
	Today, we looked at our code for the traffic light problem. From there, we also looked at how to actually run this program on a real arduino rather than a simulated circuit. 

Journal from Wednesday, November 13th
	Today, we looked at how to make a light flash. This included the light blinkng at different intervals. We also tried to do this but with using multiple lights. On top of that, we tried to find a way to convert decimal numbers to binary. Some of the code and circuitry regarding the flashing lights can be found on the README of this repository.

Journal from Monday, November 18th
	Today, we looked at logic gates. We learned about gates such as "or," "and," "not," and "xor." These functions were confusing in the beginning but after recognizing the pattern in how they work, they definitely make sense. I still am not completely sure on how the gates and the equation for an output can be integrated into the code of a program, however.
