Planning
----------
**Defining the Problem:**
For this problem, we are trying to solve a communication issue between Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Essentially, each location has transmittors and receivers which are only capable of receiving two pieces of information. 

For Mars, the planet is only able to send and receive Morse code. For Earth, the planet is only able to send and receive binary. The Moon, therefore, acts as a liason between the two planets and works to translate Morse code into binary or the opposite. However, the operators in these planets can only understand English so each language must be translated into English before being transmitted.
